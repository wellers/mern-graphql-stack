# MERN-GraphQL Stack

A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project enhanced with GraphQL to demonstrate modern API design, frontend-backend separation, and scalable data fetching patterns.

This repository showcases a practical implementation of a GraphQL API backed by a MongoDB database, along with a React frontend consuming the API using best practices.
